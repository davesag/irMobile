### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](htps://nodejs.org), version 10.16.0 (LTS) or better. (I use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage Node versions â€” `brew install nvm`.)

  ```sh
  yarn global add react-native-cli
  ```

```sh
yarn install
```

**TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE**: If you are having trouble bundling the app for the first time on ios delete `/leflair-app/ios/build`
and rerun `yarn ios`

### Devices

The Android emulator and iOS simulator are great for testing however features should be tested on physical devices prior to issuing a merge request.

_add instructions for deploying to actual devices_
